After having learnt that the The file * command determines the type of every file, I used it but just like at level 1, the file names here also started with a dash so the command is going to be slightly different

Since the task said that the The password is stored somewhere on the server, I changed
find . -type f -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 to find . -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 so that the search is not restricted to files only.
After knowing what 'somewhere on the server' actually meant, I tried find / -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6 to start searching from the root directory but this gave me a really long list of permission denied errors (along with the filename). Finally I found the password using find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null which redirected the error messages and returned only the output file

Came across the term 'grep' while working on Level 5 and was confused between find and grep. But now the difference is clear

Note: “cat data.txt | base64 -d” the base64 converts binary text representations into string texts. ‘-d’ displays in standard output.

Note: mkdir used to create a new directory. cp <source> <destination> used to copy files. mv <source> <destination> moves or renames the files. Hexdumps are basically data that cannot be represented in string format so the data shown in hex values. xxd <input file> <output file> used to create hexdumps. Compression is basically reducing the size of the file without doing any damage to the information present in the file. gzip- command used to compress the file, gzip -d used to decompress the file. gzip file usually ends with .gz.

Notes: -i keys allows only the user with the private key to access the ssh. Local host is the machine that the user is currently working on. 
level 15
password is 8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo
Notes: the password that we have to enter right after typing in the username is the one that we got in level 13-14. Since this is a private key we have to get the password for this key and that should be typed after accessing the local host. 
Local host is a hostname which has the IP address ‘127.0.0.1’. Used to access network services.
nc or netcat- command that is used to read and write data over a network. Syntax: nc <host> <port>.
level 16
password is : kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx
Notes: OpenSSL is a library for secure communication over networks. openssl s_client is the command that is used to connect to the server using SSL/TLS.
SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
TSL: Transport Layer Security
To solve this level we are first connecting to the localhost server using openSSL and sending pw to this level. The server returns the password for next level

Notes: first the the port 31000-32000 is scanned via nmap. 

 
Now each port is being opened and checked using the command ncat –ssl localhost <port>

 
Here the pw for the level 16 has to be typed and we get a private rsa key which has to be stored in a file called private16.key
The file permission has to be changed to 700
 

Now bandit17 has to be accessed
 
level 18
password is : x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO
Notes:we have to see all the files that are present in the home directory. there is one line which is different in both the files and the different line in the password.new file is the pw for level 18. The diff command can be used, this command gives us the difference between both the files.
